 <p>Player can press left arrow and right arrow button to change direction </p> 
    <p> Player can press SPACE to generate a shell.</p>
    <p> Once the enemy ship is attacked by the shell, a "bomb" can be heared. Once one single enemy ship is attacked by three times, then it will go back to the origin (0, 0) </p>
   <p>The score is to calculate how many times you attack the enemies. Once it reaches 100, then you win the game</p>
        
   <p> Once an enemy reaches the bottom and you fail to reach 100, then you lose</p>
